# my-first-portfolio-using-HTML-and-CSS
THIS PROJECT HELPED ME REALIZE I REALLY CAN DO ANYTHING I SET MY MIND TO DO
I STARTED WORKING ON IT ON THE 23RD-AUGUST-2024 AND FINISHED 26TH-AUGUST-2024
I LEARNT HOW TO EMMBED SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS INTO HTMLS 
GRID AND FLEX WERE A BIT CONFUSING BUT I LEARNT SO MUCH 
I REALIZED, I STILL HAVE CHALLENGES WITH @MEDIA QUERY, I WILL DO SOME INTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THAT

IT WAS A FUN PROJECT, AND I AM SUPER PROUD I PULLED IT OFF, 70% OFF HANDS.

on 28th-august-2024. i did research, got some tips from my mentor and finally edited my media query my mobile query is full height nowüíÉüéâ‚ù§Ô∏è
